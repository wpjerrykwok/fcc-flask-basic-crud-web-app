# Basic CRUD web app built with Flask
a project to build a basic CRUD web app with Flask and deploy to Azure

## Motivation
Web application is a software that runs in the web browser. It can be considered as a convenient way to connect with users. To supplement the use of my machine learning models, web application can provide a more user friendly interface. This project aims to build a web app and deploy to cloud environment.  

## What the app does
The app is a task management tool. Task can be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD). 

## How I built it
I used flask to build the app and flask-sqlalchemy to build the database. 

## Challenges I faced
It was not only about building the app. Care should be taken starting from development environment, until cloud deployment. It involves a lot of trials and errors to make things right. 

## Accomplishments
I successfully deployed a task management tool on the cloud. 

## What I learned
I learned how to use virtualenv to control the development environment, how to build app using flask, how to link the app with the database, how to access the database with actions, how to use html as the medium for CRUD, and how to deploy a web app to azure with github. 

## What's next for web app
I would like to explore how to connect a machine learning model with a web app. 

## Built with
flask flask-sqlalchemy gunicorn html css azure
